Powered Floor mod for Factorio
==============================


Adds tiles which provide power to whatever's sitting on top of them. Also adds a power tap to feed these tiles

-  Powered Floor Tile: Powers objects on top and neighboring tiles

-  Powered Floor Circuit Tile: Also transmits red & green circuit signals to neighboring tiles.  
                              (Does *not* feed these to objects on top.)

-  Powered Floor Tap:  A stubby electric pole that transmits power to the tiles, and circuit signals to/from the circuit tiles.
